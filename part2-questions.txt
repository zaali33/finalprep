Answer the following, add your answer below each question:

1- Open the file quiz.html in your browser and play with the game to test it. Currently, the game has a bug. Although it correctly validates answers to addition questions, it incorrectly validates answers to multiplication questions, i.e., it gives the wrong feedback. Find the commit that introduced this bug, copy and paste its ID below.

2- Don't fix the bug now, but create another branch named 'subtraction' and switch to this branch. Modify the game so that it asks the user to answer subtraction questions in addition to the multiplication and the sum questions implemented before (the operation must be chosen randomly). You have to make at least three commits while you are implementing this functionality. Copy and paste the ID of each commit you made below.

3- Push the changes you made to the remote.

4- Switch back to the master branch, fix the bug that you found above in a new commit and paste its ID below.

5- Merge the two branches and resolve any conflicts you get. Then push your changes to the remote.
